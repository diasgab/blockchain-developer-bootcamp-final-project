## Project description

A user can create a portfolio by selecting from the assets available in Balancer contract. A portfolio consists of assets with their corresponding percentage assignment being the maximum 100%.

The main goal is to allow the user in a simple manner to keep the same risk tolerance when creating a portfolio.

Let's use a simple example to demonstrate this. A user wants to distribute 1 ETH in the following way:
- 70% into UNI token
- 30% into BAT token

What happens upon price fluctuations?

Let's assume the price of UNI token increases, then the portfolio distribution might look like this:
- 65% into UNI token
- 35% into BAT token

This is good news because the portfolio value has probably increased. But it also increased the exposure to the BAT token.

To correct this manually the user might Sell a certain amount of the BAT token and Buy a certain amount of UNI token.

To make the user life easier he could run a portfolio rebalance using this tool and keep the same risk tolerance that he established when creating the portfolio in the first place.

## How to run this project locally

### Prerequisites

- Truffle v5.3.7 (core: 5.3.7)
- Solidity - 0.8.6 (solc-js)
- Node v12.16.1 (you can use `nvm use v12.16.1`)
- Web3.js v1.3.6
- Ganache CLI v6.12.2
- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/diasgab/blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project.git`

### Contracts

- Open a terminal and run a forked version of Rinkeby using ganache-cli in port `8545`: `ganache-cli -d --fork https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/<RINKEBY_INFURA_PROJECT_ID>`
- NOTE: for the purpose of testing this project and only for limited time you can use RINKEBY_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=bc260ee834fb40c588d58424b626f79b
- On a new terminal (while ganache-cli is running in the other one): `cd <PROJECT_ROOT>`
- Run `npm install` in project root to install Truffle and build and smart contract dependencies.
- `cp .env.example .env`
- Edit `.env` file to add RINKEBY_INFURA_PROJECT_ID parameter (bc260ee834fb40c588d58424b626f79b). For deploying to rinkeby you will need also a mnemonic with test ETH.
- Run truffle by connecting to Ganache-cli client: `truffle console --network rinkebylocal`
- Run `truffle(rinkebylocal)> compile`
- Run `truffle(rinkebylocal)> migrate --reset` (this will also create a config file with the new contract address for the client)
- Run tests in Truffle console: `truffle(rinkebylocal)> test`
- `rinkebylocal` network id is 1337, remember to change it in Metamask as well!
- When running the tests you should see something like:

### Frontend

- To have some available assets to create your portfolio, in the same truffle terminal run: `truffle(rinkebylocal)> exec scripts/add_default_tokens.js`
- Then in a new terminal: `cd client`
- The client dapp consists of static files. You could run it from VS Code with lite-server. But you can also run it from the terminal:
- `npm install`
- `npx lite-server`
- Open `http://localhost:3000`

### Considerations when running it local

- Make sure you execute Truffle using the rinkebylocal network:
  - `truffle console --network rinkebylocal`
  - `truffle(rinkebylocal)> compile`
  - `truffle(rinkebylocal)> migrate --reset`
- Make sure you create some test tokens to be able to create your portfolio:
  - `truffle(rinkebylocal)> exec scripts/add_default_tokens.js`
- Have some test ether in your Metamask wallet to test the app:
  - Option 1: Send ETH to local wallet: `truffle(rinkebylocal)> web3.eth.sendTransaction({ from: "<your local address>", to: "<your local network wallet>", value: web3.utils.toWei("10") })`
  - Option 2: NOTE: you can also import a new test account from the ones generated by Ganache-cli using the private key
- Install lite-server or use VS Code lite server:
  - `cd client && npx lite-server`
  - Open local ui from `http://localhost:3000`
- Make sure your Metamask localhost network is in port `8545` and chain id is `1337`.
- If you get `TXRejectedError` when sending a transaction, reset your Metamask account from Advanced settings.


## Simple workflow

1. Enter balancer web site
2. Connect to Metamask
3. Deposit some ether
4. Create a portfolio
5. Run the first portfolio distribution
6. Run a portfolio rebalance any time you want
7. Delete a portfolio to receive the portfolio asset balances in your balancer balance
8. Withdraw your funds in ether

## Directory structure

- `client`: Project frontend.
- `contracts`: Smart contracts that are deployed in the Rinkeby testnet.
- `migrations`: Migration files for deploying contracts in `contracts` directory.
- `test`: Tests for smart contracts.

## Environment variables

```
RINKEBY_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=
RINKEBY_MNEMONIC=
```
RINKEBY_MNEMONIC is not needed unless you want to deploy to Rinkeby.

### Known issues and limitations

- It's needed to save a reserve from the deposited amount that will work as a gas reserve to make every rebalance. Now it's a fixed number of 0.02 ETH that is needed to run every rebalance.
- The balancer contract is holding a price cache per asset. This might be too expensive and not reliable and could be replaced by an external oracle.
- There is a fine detailed analysis that has to be made in order to assure the balances are correct after the buy and sell orders are executed. It's necessary to make sure that the contract is not spending more than just the necessary.
- It's too expensive to run a portfolio rebalance, but it might be still cheaper than buying the assets one by one.
- There is a lot of optimization that can be made in the Solidity code. Mostly about array iteration and how the information is stored.

## Roadmap for automatic rebalance (Not implemented)

1. Once a portfolio is created the user can select the conditions when a portfolio rebalance should happen:
    1. Every 1 hour, once a day, once a week, etc
    2. After x% increment or decrement in the expected portfolio balance
2. A user would be able to create N portfolios.
3. A user could specify which amount to assign to a portfolio
4. When deleting a portfolio a user can select whether to convert all the assets to ETH or keep the tokens

## TODO features

- Let the user add assets to an existing portfolio.
- Convert the fronted to a React app.
